## **Preface**

### **The Machine Learning Tsunami**

In 2006, Geoffrey Hinton et al. published a paper<sup>1</sup> showing how to train a deep neural network capable of recognizing handwritten digits with state-of-the-art precision (>98%). They branded this technique "deep learning". A deep neural network is a (very) simplified model of our cerebral cortex, composed of a stack of layers of artificial neurons. Training a deep neural net was widely considered impossible at the time,<sup>2</sup> and most researchers had abandoned the idea in the late 1990s. This paper revived the interest of the scientific community, and before long many new papers demonstrated that deep learning was not only possible, but capable of mind-blowing achievements that no other machine learning (ML) technique could hope to match (with the help of tremendous computing power and great amounts of data). This enthusiasm soon extended to many other areas of machine learning.

A decade later, machine learning had conquered the industry, and today it is at the heart of much of the magic in high-tech products, ranking your web search results, powering your smartphone's speech recognition, recommending videos, and perhaps even driving your car.

### **Machine Learning in Your Projects**

So, naturally you are excited about machine learning and would love to join the party!

Perhaps you would like to give your homemade robot a brain of its own? Make it recognize faces? Or learn to walk around?

Or maybe your company has tons of data (user logs, financial data, production data, machine sensor data, hotline stats, HR reports, etc.), and more than likely you could unearth some hidden gems if you just knew where to look. With machine learning, you could accomplish the following and much more:

- Segment customers and find the best marketing strategy for each group.
- Recommend products for each client based on what similar clients bought.
- Detect which transactions are likely to be fraudulent.
- Forecast next year's revenue.

Whatever the reason, you have decided to learn machine learning and implement it in your projects. Great idea!
